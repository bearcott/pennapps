Android app that adjusts the intensity of your playlist while you're running

**The Big Idea**
- fast upbeat music is more effective in bringing higher levels of [cortisol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol) after exercise (a steroid hormone that increases hormones.) as opposed to no/sedative music.
- fast music is encouraged before a workout in order to increase respiration levels and "warm the blood."
- the heart beats an average of 72-80 bps, music can range from 70-120 bps. (Moderate exercise lies around 120ish bps.)
- as a general curve, music enhances the enjoyment and compliance to fitness routines. This of course varies by personality. 
- You want to stay 50 percent to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. This range is your target heart rate.
- Your maximum heart rate is about 220 minus your age.
- slowly declining heart rate means you're more fit
- Male athletes : HRmax = 202 - (0.55 x age)
- Female athletes : HRmax = 216 - (1.09 x age)
- Exercise intensity : %HRmax = 0.64 Ã— %VO2max + 37
